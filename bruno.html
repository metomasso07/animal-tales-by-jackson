            <p>Meet Buzz, a hardworking honeybee who lived in a busy hive with hundreds of bee friends.</p>
            
            <p>One sunny morning, Buzz and his bee crew buzzed from flower to flower, collecting sweet nectar. They worked all day long, filling their pollen baskets. Back at the hive, they turned the nectar into golden, delicious honey. They made so much honey!</p>
            
            <p>But then, trouble arrived. A big, hungry bear sniffed the air and smelled their honey. He lumbered toward the hive, licking his lips. "Mmm, I want that honey!" the bear growled.</p>
            
            <p>Buzz and his crew buzzed nervously. What could they do? The bear was so big!</p>
            
            <p>"Wait for my signal," whispered Buzz. As the bear reached his giant paw toward the hive to grab the honey, Buzz shouted, "NOW!"</p>
            
            <p>BUZZ! BUZZ! BUZZ! All the bees swarmed around the bear, stinging his nose and paws. "OUCH! OUCH!" yelled the bear. He stumbled backward, swatting at the bees.</p>
            
            <p>The bear gave up and ran away into the forest, rubbing his sore nose. Buzz and his friends had saved their honey! They worked hard for it, and they protected it together.</p>

            <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Bees collect nectar from flowers to make honey, which they eat during winter. Their eyes are made of thousands of tiny lenses, and they can see ultraviolet colors that humans can't see!</p>
