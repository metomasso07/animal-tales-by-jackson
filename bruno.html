            <p>Meet Bruno, a curious baby boar with fuzzy brown fur and a little pink nose.</p>
            
            <p>One sunny morning, Bruno asked his mama, "Can I go explore the forest? I want to see what's out there!"</p>
            
            <p>His mama smiled. "Of course, but stay close to me."</p>
            
            <p>Bruno and his mama trotted through the trees, sniffing the air and looking for acorns. Suddenly, Bruno stopped. "Mama, look!"</p>
            
            <p>Right ahead of them stood a pack of wolves! Their golden eyes gleamed in the shadows. Bruno's heart pounded. Wolves were big and had sharp teeth!</p>
            
            <p>The biggest wolf stepped forward. Bruno hid behind his mama, trembling.</p>
            
            <p>But then something amazing happened. The wolf leader wagged his tail! "Hello, friends," he said gently. "We're just looking for berries. Would you like to help us?"</p>
            
            <p>Bruno peeked out. The wolves weren't scary at all—they were friendly! Bruno and his mama spent the afternoon picking berries and playing with their new wolf friends.</p>
            
            <p>Sometimes the scariest-looking creatures turn out to be the kindest!</p>

            <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Baby boars are called piglets! They're born with fuzzy hair and cute stripes that help them blend into the forest. As they grow up, their stripes fade away.</p>
