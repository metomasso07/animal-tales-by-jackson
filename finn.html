            <p>Meet Finn, a bright orange fish who lived in a beautiful coral reef with his wife and eight baby fish. Finn loved his big family!</p>
            
            <p>One morning, Finn woke up extra hungry. His tummy rumbled, and so did his wife's and all eight babies' tummies too! "We need food!" chirped the little fish.</p>
            
            <p>"I'll find us breakfast," said Finn bravely. He swam out of their cozy coral home to search for tasty algae and tiny shrimp. But as he rounded a big rock, Finn gasped—a huge shark was swimming nearby!</p>
            
            <p>Finn's heart raced. He darted back home as fast as his fins could carry him. "There's a shark out there!" he told his family.</p>
            
            <p>But then something surprising happened. The shark poked his head around their coral. "Hi, neighbors!" he said with a big, toothy smile. "I just moved here. Want to play?"</p>
            
            <p>The shark wasn't dangerous at all—he only ate plankton! Finn and his family spent the whole day playing hide-and-seek in the reef with their new friend. After a fun day of games, they all went home for a delicious dinner together.</p>
