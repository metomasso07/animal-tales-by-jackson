            <p>Meet Stretch, the tallest giraffe in the whole savanna. He loved munching on leaves from the tallest trees.</p>
            
            <p>One morning, Stretch woke up hungry and stretched his long neck high to find breakfast. But oh no! All the leaves near his home were gone. Stretch had to be brave and venture far away to find food.</p>
            
            <p>He walked and walked until he spotted a tree full of delicious green leaves. Perfect! But as Stretch reached up to take a bite, he noticed something scary sleeping under the tree—a big lion with sharp teeth and claws!</p>
            
            <p>Stretch froze. He tried to tiptoe away quietly, but CRACK! His hoof stepped on a stick. The lion's eyes popped open!</p>
            
            <p>"ROAR!" The lion jumped up and started chasing Stretch!</p>
            
            <p>Stretch ran as fast as he had ever run in his life. His long legs stretched out with each stride. The lion was fast, but Stretch was faster! He ran and ran until finally, the tired lion gave up and went back to nap.</p>
            
            <p>Stretch made it home safely. Being tall and fast saved the day!</p>
