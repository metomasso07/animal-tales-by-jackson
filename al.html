            <p>Meet Al, an alligator who lived in a peaceful swamp. Al had big teeth and a long tail, which made him look very scary. But Al wasn't scary at all—he just wanted to make friends!</p>
            
            <p>One warm day, Al spotted a family of ducks swimming near his favorite log. "Hello!" Al called out with a big smile.</p>
            
            <p>But when the ducks saw Al's teeth, they quacked in fear and swam away as fast as they could!</p>
            
            <p>Al felt sad. "Why won't anyone be my friend?" he wondered.</p>
            
            <p>Later that day, Al heard a tiny voice. "Help! Help!" A baby turtle was stuck upside down on the riverbank, unable to flip over.</p>
            
            <p>Al gently used his snout to flip the turtle right side up. "There you go, little friend!"</p>
            
            <p>The baby turtle looked up at Al with big eyes. "Thank you! You're so kind! Would you like to be my friend?"</p>
            
            <p>Al's heart filled with joy. "Really? You're not scared of me?"</p>
            
            <p>"Of course not," said the turtle. "You just helped me! You're the nicest alligator I've ever met."</p>
            
            <p>From that day on, Al and the turtle became best friends. Al learned that being kind is what really matters, not how you look!</p>
