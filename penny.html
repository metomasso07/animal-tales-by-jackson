            <p>Meet Penny, a gentle panda who lived in the misty bamboo forest with her two cubs.</p>
            
            <p>One sunny morning, Penny and her cubs wandered deep into the forest, looking for fresh bamboo to eat. Crunch, crunch, crunch! They loved munching on the tender green shoots.</p>
            
            <p>Suddenly, they heard a rustling sound. A big tiger stepped out from behind the trees! Penny's heart raced.</p>
            
            <p>"Hello," said the tiger in a surprisingly gentle voice. "I'm Terry. I don't mean any harm."</p>
            
            <p>Penny was confused. Everyone said tigers were dangerous! But Terry seemed friendly.</p>
            
            <p>"I'm actually a vegetarian tiger," Terry explained. "I only eat plants and bamboo, just like you! Other animals are usually too scared to talk to me because of how I look."</p>
            
            <p>Penny felt bad for judging Terry by his appearance. "I'm sorry I was scared," she said. "Would you like to share some bamboo with us?"</p>
            
            <p>Terry's eyes lit up. "Really? That would be wonderful!"</p>
            
            <p>From that day on, Penny and Terry became good friends. Penny learned that you shouldn't judge someone by how they look—what matters is what's in their heart.</p>

            <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Pandas eat bamboo for up to 14 hours a day! They need to eat a lot because bamboo doesn't have many nutrients.</p>
