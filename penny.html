            <p>Meet Penny, a gentle panda who lived in the misty bamboo forest with her two cubs.</p>
            
            <p>One sunny morning, Penny and her cubs wandered deep into the forest, looking for fresh bamboo to eat. Crunch, crunch, crunch! They loved munching on the tender green shoots.</p>
            
            <p>Suddenly, they heard a rustling sound. A big tiger stepped out from behind the trees! Penny's heart raced. She moved her cubs close behind her, ready to protect them.</p>
            
            <p>But the tiger smiled kindly. "Hello, friends! Don't be scared. I know where there's a cave full of the most delicious bamboo you've ever tasted. Would you like to share it with me?"</p>
            
            <p>Penny was surprised. "Really? You want to share with us?"</p>
            
            <p>"Of course!" said the tiger. "There's plenty for everyone."</p>
            
            <p>The tiger led them to a hidden cave filled with sweet, crunchy bamboo stalks. Penny and her cubs ate and ate until their bellies were full and round. The tiger munched on bamboo too—he was a vegetarian!</p>
            
            <p>They all sat together in the warm sun, happy and full. Sometimes the best friendships come from the most unexpected places!</p>

        <div class="fun-fact">
            <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Pandas spend 12-16 hours a day eating bamboo! Their diet is made up of bamboo stems, shoots, and leaves. Even though they look like bears, they're actually quite gentle and love to munch peacefully all day long.</p>
