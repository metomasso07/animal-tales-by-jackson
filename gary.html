            <p>Meet Gary, a clever little gecko who loved exploring the forest.</p>
            
            <p>One sunny day, Gary was climbing high up in his favorite tree when he heard a loud noise below. He looked down and gasped—there was a big, hungry bear right under his tree!</p>
            
            <p>Gary froze on the branch. His heart was beating fast. The bear looked up and sniffed the air. "Mmm, a tasty snack!" the bear growled.</p>
            
            <p>The bear started climbing up the tree toward Gary! Gary thought quickly. He remembered that geckos have a special trick—sticky toe pads that help them climb anywhere, even upside down!</p>
            
            <p>As the bear got closer, Gary scurried to the very tip of a thin branch where the heavy bear couldn't follow. The branch started to bend and crack under the bear's weight.</p>
            
            <p>SNAP! The branch broke and the bear tumbled down safely into a big pile of leaves below. He wasn't hurt, just embarrassed! The bear waddled away to find berries instead.</p>
            
            <p>Gary was safe, thanks to his amazing climbing skills!</p>

        <div class="fun-fact">
            <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Geckos have sticky toe pads covered in millions of tiny hairs that let them climb on glass, trees, and even walk upside down on ceilings!</p>
